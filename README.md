Run `Tetris.exe` to start the game

Running the exe might not work if java isn't installed on the computer. in that case, copy the "java" folder from the java.zip file into the root of the project as follows https://i.imgur.com/leNlu4i.png

Absolutely! Here's a README.md focused on the backend logic and code implementation for your Tetris project:

# Tetris Backend Implementation

This README outlines the core logic and code structures behind my Tetris implementation in Processing.

## Key Design Decisions

* **Data Structures:**
    * The game board is represented as a 2D array of `Tile` objects. Each `Tile` stores its color and occupancy state (empty or filled).
    * Tetromino shapes are implemented using the `Shape` class. A `Shape` comprises an array of `Tile` objects defining its structure, a pivot point for rotation, and its color.

## Core Game Logic

* **Shape Generation:**
    * A random Tetromino shape from a predefined set (`i`, `j`, `l`, `o`, `s`, `t`, `z`) is generated at the top of the board.
    * Collision detection prevents shapes from spawning in invalid positions that would result in immediate game over.


* **Movement and Collision Detection:**
    * **Downward Movement:** Shapes descend at regular intervals. The `Fall()` function within the `Shape` class handles downward movement and collision detection with the board and settled pieces.
    * **Lateral Movement:**  The `move()` function handles left/right movement, with the `moveBlocked()` function ensuring movement validity.
    * **Rotation:**   Rotation is implemented using rotation matrices, with checks to prevent rotations that would place blocks outside the board or within occupied tiles.

* **Ghost Piece:**
    * A ghost piece is rendered to provide a visual preview of where the current shape will land.  Its position is calculated by simulating the shape's fall until it collides.

* **Line Clearing:**
     * The board is scanned for complete rows. When found, rows are cleared by:
        *  Altering the color of the tiles to create a visual flash effect.
       *   Dropping tiles down using a gravity algorithm (described below).

* **Gravity:**
    * After a line clear, a gravity function iterates through the board, identifying connected 'segments' of blocks that are no longer supported. These segments are treated as independent shapes and moved downward according to the `Fall()` logic.

## Code Structure

* **`setup()`:** Initializes the game board and data structures.
* **`draw()`:** The main game loop responsible for rendering, updating game logic, and handling user input.
* **`keyPressed()`/`keyReleased()`:** Handle keyboard controls for movement, rotation, hard drop, and pausing the game.
* **`Shape` class:** Encapsulates the properties and behavior of Tetrominoes: 
    * `Fall()` 
    * `rotate()`
    * `move()`
* **`Tile` class:** Represents an individual cell on the Tetris board.

## Potential Improvements

* **Line clearing optimization:** Explore more efficient algorithms for line clearing.
* **Scoring system:** Implement a scoring system based on line clears and difficulty.
* **Level progression:** Increase difficulty by speeding up the falling pieces over time.

## Notes

This project demonstrates a solid understanding of game development concepts in Processing, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and game logic implementation.
